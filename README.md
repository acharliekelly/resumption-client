# Resumption - Full-Stack Online Resume App (Client)

This is the front-end of my Online Resume App. It is pretty much just like every online resume app, except that there's just me writing it, and I'm under some time constraints that are perhaps more severe than those on commercial apps. As such, I've made some modifications to the basic idea in order to accomodate my schedule. But also, my reason for creating this app is that my own resume needs are fairly complex. So I want an app that lets me try more things - maybe ultimately do some A/B testing on hiring managers.

So, core idea is that a resume can be broken up into sections (not an especially ground-breaking idea). But in my app, the relationship of sections to resumes is many-to-many. I want the ability to create multiple versions of each section (ie, different combinations of skills, different work histories, etc). They'll all be accurate, but I have a long history, and not all my past jobs are relevant to all prospective roles.
